# gold-prices-project2
This mini project displays a line chart of the gold price in the last 15 days. This mini project uses Gold API as the data source, and Python to extract the data and transform it into an excel file to be loaded to Tableau for data visualization.

Step-by-step of how the project is created:
1. Sign up to https://www.goldapi.io/ to get API for the latest gold prices.
2. Create a Python script that will get the data from the API and select the necessary fields that will be later used for the chart.
3. Run the file to create an excel file.
4. Sign in and use Tableau Public then connect the excel file.
5. Create chart in Tableau.
